#Introduction
 Chinese word segment is widely studied in document analysis.
 In this paper, combining the Transformer-XL layer, the Fully-Connect layer, and the Conditional Random Field layer,
 the proposed model improved 3.23% in macro-F1 score, comparing to the BERT+CRF model, on the MSR2005 Chinese word segment test dataset.
